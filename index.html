        BitShares revolutionizes how <strong>money and value</strong> is exchanged. </span>
      </div>

      <p>BitShares exists entirely as a decentralized transaction ledger
      (i.e. a <strong>blockchain</strong>) maintained by a network of
      individual computers owned by regular people all over the world.
      It offers a free market for transactions of any kind that can be
      performed between person to person over the internet without any
      third party middlemen.</p>

      <p>BitShares offers the world's first decentralized exchange for
      cryptographically secured financial assets, that allows you to
      trade in euro, gold, bitcoin, and more without counterparty
      risk.</p>

      <p>BitShares is based on the <strong>Graphene</strong>-technology
      which has several orders of magnitude better performance than
      first-generation Bitcoin-derived systems. Graphene based systems
      go beyond mere "checkbook" style payments and offer a wide range
      of transparent and inherently incorruptible financial services
      that can be extended by any <strong>smart contracts</strong> to
      add more functionality.</p>

      <p>BitShares is a business in its own that offers products that
      generate a revenue. Owning the core token in BitShares (BTS) not
      only allows to take part in business decision making, but allows
      makes you an owner of a bank, an exchange and the future financial
      transactions platform.</p>

      Market Pegged Assets (MPA) allow to use a digital asset that represents a
      physical counterparty. In other words, MPAs can be considered as derivatives
      and are subject of contracts for difference (CFDs).

       <h2>The Dex</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      BitShares, has its own decentralized exchange integrated that
      allows to trade any arbitrary asset against any other asset at
      real-time speed. All markets have global order books and operate
      24/7 on a global network without the need for middlemen.

      <div class="title">
       <h2>Own Your Identity</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      With BitShares, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can
      collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a
      payment without revealing your identity, almost just like with physical
      money.  You should however take note that some effort can be required to
      protect your privacy.

       <h2>Flexible</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      BitShares was designed with extreme flexibility and in mind. It can not only
      be extended by new types of transactions, but can also have its protocol
      completely upgraded on-the-fly if the shareholders agree. Nasty discussion
      about the "block size limit" are now history.

       <h2>Global Trading</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      With BitAssets, a market-pegged derivative of a physical counterpart, e.g.
      bitUSD or bitGOLD, the BitShares Decentralized Exchange (DEX) allows
      world-wide trading of arbitrary market pairs. The DEX not only reflects
      classical FOREX pair such as USD:EUR using the corresponding BitAssets, i.e.
      bitUSD:bitEUR, but also allows trading of commodities like bitGOLD,
      bitSILVER, etc. against any other asset. Furthermore, with privatized
      BitAssets, it is possible to trade derivatives of indices, such as Dow
      Jones, DAX, or Hang Seng,
      </p>
     </div>

     <div class="column2"> <span class="icon icon-money"></span>
      <div class="title">
       <h2>Cheaper Internet Payments</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      Today, convenient Payments are performed electronically by using a 3rd-party
      service, such as Paypal, Neteller, or Dwolla. They all require you to
      register an account, reveal your personal identity and ask for high fees. By
      using a decentralized business, the transaction fees can be significantly
      reduced, the need for trust is eliminated and transfers execute in seconds.
      </p>
     </div>

     <div class="column3"> <span class="icon icon-building"></span>
      <div class="title">
       <h2>Easier Stock Trading</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      Besides trading of the market-pegged BitAssets, BitShares also offers to
      issue your own stock in the DEX at comparably low cost. These user-issued
      assets (UIA) can fully comply with the regulations of most governments and
      offer additional functionalities for issuer and investors.

      <div class="title">
       <h2>Faster Crowd Fundraising</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      With BitShares, decentralized crowd funding never was easier. Technically
      the process breaks down to as few as two steps: a) Create a new token that
      should represent your project, and b) issue and sell your shares on the DEX.
      It's your choice whether you want to sell them for bitUSD, bitEUR, or any
      other token and you define the price for the share. The MOONFUND token of
      moonstone.io was among the first crowd funding tokens to use BitShares.

       <h2>Prediction Markets</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      A debit card for bitUSD/bitEUR or any other bitasset is easily implemented
      using the Recurring &amp; Scheduled Payment functionalities of BitShares. Here,
      any costumer can authorized a credit card issuer to withdraw up to a
      predefined amount of bitUSD from your account in a defined period, e.g. $1k
      per month, or $100 per week. With this, it also becomes possible for your
      landlord to obtain your rent simply by allowing him to withdraw from your
      account once per month.
      </p>
     </div>

     <div class="column2"> <span class="icon fa-clock-o"></span>
      <div class="title">
       <h2>Recurring Payments</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
      Prediction markets are quickly implemented with BitShares and the DEX. All
      that is needed a proper prediction criteria in the description of a newly
      created asset that anybody can issue by putting up collateral. The price of
      this asset reflects the probability of an event to occur. Participants that
      have voted correctly will be able to sell their shares back to the network
      at a higher price and make a profit. This feature, in combination with the
      bitUSD, allows to reimplement most binary prediction and information markets
      currently established in a decentralized and trust-less manner.
