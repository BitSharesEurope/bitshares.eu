     BitShares revolutionizes how <strong>money and value</strong> is exchanged. </span>
   </div>

   <p>BitShares exists entirely as a decentralized transaction ledger
   (i.e. a <strong>blockchain</strong>) maintained by a network of
   individual computers owned by regular people all over the world.
   It offers a free market for transactions of <em>any kind</em> that
   can be performed between person to person over the internet
   without any third party middlemen.</p>

   <p>BitShares offers the world's first <strong>decentralized
    exchange</strong> for cryptographically secured financial assets,
   that allows you to trade in euro, gold, bitcoin, and more without
   counterparty risk.</p>

   <p>BitShares is based on the <strong>Graphene</strong>&trade;-technology
   which has several orders of magnitude better performance than
   first-generation Bitcoin-derived systems. Graphene&trade; based systems
   go beyond mere "checkbook" style payments and offer a wide range
   of transparent and inherently incorruptible financial services
   that can be extended by any <strong>smart contracts</strong> to
   add more functionality.</p>

   <p>BitShares is a business in its own that offers products that
   generate a revenue. Owning the core token in BitShares (BTS) not
   only allows to take part in business decision making, but allows
   makes you an owner of a bank, an exchange and the future financial
   transactions platform.</p>

   <span class="byline">Power by Graphene&trade;</span> </div>
  <div class="column1"> <span class="icon entypo-trophy"></span>
   <div class="title">
    <h2>Stable Crypto Currencies</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   Market Pegged Assets (MPA) or SmartCoins&trade; allow to use a
   digital asset that represents a <strong>physical
    counterparty</strong>. In other words, MPAs can be considered as
   derivatives and are subject of <strong>contracts for
    difference</strong> (CFDs).

   <div class="title">
    <h2>The DEX&trade;</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   BitShares, has its own <strong>decentralized exchange</strong>
   (DEX) integrated that allows to trade any arbitrary asset against
   any other asset at real-time speed. All markets have global order
   books and operate <strong>24/7 on a global scale</strong> without
   the need for middlemen and no single point of failure.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2"> <span class="icon entypo-language"></span>
   <div class="title">
    <h2>Own Your Identity</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   With BitShares, there is no credit card number that some malicious
   actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even
   possible to send a <strong>payment without revealing your
    identity</strong>, almost just like with physical money. You
   should however take note that some effort can be required to
   <strong>protect your privacy</strong>.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column3"> <span class="icon entypo-paper-plane"></span>
   <div class="title">
    <h2>Smart Contracts</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   BitShares was designed with <strong>extreme flexibility</strong>
   and the <strong>smallest possible delay</strong> in mind. It can
   not only be extended by <strong>new types of
    transactions</strong>, but can also have its protocol completely
   upgraded <strong>on-the-fly</strong> if the shareholders agree.

    <h2>Global Trading</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   With Smartcoins&trade;, a market-pegged derivative of a physical
   counterpart, e.g.  <tt>bitUSD</tt> or <tt>bitGOLD</tt>, the BitShares Decentralized
   Exchange (DEX) allows world-wide trading of arbitrary market
   pairs. The DEX not only reflects classical FOREX pair such as
   <tt>USD:EUR</tt> using the corresponding Smartcoins&trade; but also allows trading of commodities like
   <tt>bitGOLD</tt>, <tt>bitSILVER</tt>, etc.
   </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column2"> <span class="icon icon-money"></span>
   <div class="title">
    <h2>Cheaper Internet Payments</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   Today, convenient payments are performed electronically by using a
   3rd-party service, such as Paypal, Neteller, or Dwolla.  They all
   require you to register an account, reveal your personal identity
   and hobbies and ask for high fees. By using a decentralized
   business, the transaction <strong>fees can be significantly
    reduced</strong>, the need for trust is eliminated and
   <strong>transfers execute in seconds</strong>.
   </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column3"> <span class="icon icon-building"></span>
   <div class="title">
    <h2>Easier Stock Trading</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   Besides trading of the market-pegged Assets, BitShares also offers
   to issue your own stock in the DEX at comparably low cost. These
   user-issued assets (UIA) can <strong>fully comply with the
    regulations</strong> of most governments and offer additional
   functionalities for issuer and investors. Furthermore, with
   <strong>privatized Smartcoins&trade;</strong>, it is possible to
   trade derivatives of indices, such as Dow Jones, DAX, or Hang
   Seng.

    <h2>Faster Crowd Fundraising</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   With BitShares, <strong>decentralized crowd funding</strong> never
   was easier. Technically the process breaks down to as few as two
   steps: a) Create a new token that should represent your project,
   and b) issue and sell your shares on the DEX. It's your choice
   whether you want to sell them for <tt>bitUSD</tt>,
   <tt>bitEUR</tt>, or any other token and you define the price for
   the share.

   <div class="title">
    <h2>Prediction Markets</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   All that is needed to create a Prediction markets is a proper
   prediction criteria in the description for a new asset that
   anybody can issue by putting up collateral. The price of this
   asset reflects the probability of an event to occur. Participants
   that have voted correctly will be able to sell their shares back
   to the network at a higher price and make a profit. This feature,
   in combination with the <tt>bitUSD</tt>, allows to reimplement
   most binary prediction and information markets currently
   established in a <strong>decentralized and trust-less
    manner</strong>.

  <div class="column2"> <span class="icon fa-clock-o"></span>
   <div class="title">
    <h2>Recurring Payments</h2>
   </div>
   <p>
   A debit card for <tt>bitUSD</tt>/<tt>bitEUR</tt> or any other
   bitasset is easily implemented using the Recurring &amp; Scheduled
   Payment functionalities of BitShares. Here, any costumer can
   <strong>authorize a credit card issuer</strong> to withdraw
   <strong>up to a predefined amount</strong> of bitUSD from your
   account <strong>in a defined period</strong>, e.g. $1k per month,
   or $100 per week. With this, it also becomes possible for your
   landlord to obtain your rent simply by allowing him to withdraw
   from your account once per month.
