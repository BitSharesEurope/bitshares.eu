title: BitShares 2.0 now officially Bitcoin 3.0 tech!
---

At this year's blockchain conference [d10e in Amsterdam in February](http://d10e.org) the Chief Executive Officer and Bitcoin core developer, Jeff Garzik, has present his visions of Bitcoin3.0 going way beyond just [Smart Contracts](http://www.slideshare.net/jgarzik/bitcoin-30-beyond-smart-contracts).

According to Garzik, the main components of a Bitcoin 3.0 comprise cryptographic tokens and assets, censorship-resistance, smart contracts identities and reputation as well as digital facts and attestation. Let's quickly compare this with what is possible in BitShares 2.0 already today:

* Smart Contracts: *check*

  BitShares 2.0 can be extended by any kind of smart contract written in ultra fast and scalable C++. In contrast to Ethereum, BitShares 2.0 requires shareholder approval for any extension which makes it less flexible for prototyping but way more scalable, faster and more secure because the code has to code through several independent review processes and approval voting. From business perspective, such smart contracts could even be funded by Fee Backed Assets (see later articles).

* Censorship-resistance, tokens, and assets: *check*

  Of course, BitShares 2.0 offers a variety of digital assets, such as market-pegged assets (a combination of assets with a contract for difference implemented as a smart contract), user-issued assets for stock, event tickets or owner ship tracking, as well as prediction markets. All of them come with censorship resistance, of course!

* Digital facts: *semi-check*

  Depending on the interpretation of *facts*, the BitShares 2.0 network can already be used to witness prices and implement notary services for digital documents. Digital oracles are on the list of things to do but are very well feasible already.

* Digital Identify, Reputation and Attestation: *check*

  In contrast to any other existing crypto ecosystem, BitShares 2.0 already has an identity management that is already used by businesses like OpenLedger to bootstrap a web-of-verified-trust by means of white- and black-listing. In combination with the Proposal system, threshold multi-signature schemes and customize-able operation content, an attestation system could be started today!

Finally, we can conclude that

**BitShares 2.0 can be considered a Bitcoin 3.0 technology already today, acknowledged by Geff Garzik, core developer of Bitcoin**
