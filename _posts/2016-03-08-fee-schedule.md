title: New Fee Schedule in Place
---

After several days of intensive discussion, the BitShares committee has constructed a whole new fee schedule for the BitShares ecosystem that has **drastically reduces** the fees required for the **core features**, namely, *transfers* and *trading*, but increases the fees of more specialized operations that are rarely used.

Even though this fee schedule has had a lot of thoughts, we we will have more options once BSIP#10 or the rate-limited free transfer is available to be implemented for bitassets owned by the committee. In the mean time, however, we would like to give everyone the opportunity to make use of a low flat fee for all transfers with in the network and have decided to ask for $0.018 per transfer! Going forward with this fee schedule, we will track the **USD denomination** of fees and thus update the schedule if the valuation of BTS changes. Keep in mind that even though the fees are denominated in USD now, the actual fees may vary slightly depending on BTS valuation.

We would further like to encourage traders and market makers to provide liquidity by asking for only $0.001 per created order (with 90% refund on cancellation if unfilled) and a low 0% trading fee for committee owned assets such as bitUSD, etc. By this, BitShares offers the most **competitive rates** of all available exchanges while offering more security and availability than our centralized competitors.

Fee Roadmap
-----------

In order to show stability to current and new businesses, the committee has agreed to not change fees in the 6 months ahead of us and evaluate the networks business performance in the mean-time. Thus, you can calculate with the current fee schedule, unless significant arguments are raised to the committee that might require a change in fee.

During these 6 months, the performance will be constantly evaluated and plans for an updated fee schedule will be evaluated in the best interest to BitShares' shareholders. Only after these 6 months and public discussion, a new fee schedule will be proposed, if needed.
