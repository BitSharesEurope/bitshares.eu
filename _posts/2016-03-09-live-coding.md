title: BitShares Python Coding - Youtube Lesson (I)
---

After putting quite some work into the Python libraries for graphene-based blockchains, such as BitShares, there finally was a first live coding session to introduce the library to enthusiastic python coders.

<!--more-->

The first session covered the following topics:

- Running the cli_wallet & witness_node with open RPC ports
- Installation of Python Library
- Basics about BitShares Objects and the blockchain
- Basics about how to interface with wallet & witness node
- Advanced interfacing and websocket notifications

The 1h10min long record can be found [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKg53MQw6GA). Soon, there will be more sessions. I recommend to subscribe to the [discussion thread](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,21816.msg284338.html#msg284338)
