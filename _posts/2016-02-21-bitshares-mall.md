title: BitShares as a Platform
---

In this article, I'd like to discuss with you, how BitShares is a platform for businesses. For that and given that blockchain technologies are usualy considered *complicated*, I'd like reimagine everything from ground up and compare BitShares with a platform that offers a *common ground* infrastructure to its customers, participants and business partners.

The first and maybe simplest non-technical analogy would be

**BitShares as a global shopping mall**

Wait, what? How is that? And if so, what kind of *shops* would there be? What could I shop there and is it cheaper?

To answer these question and give you an impression of what will come next, let's take BitShares apart and see what components we have:

* Existing and Upcoming Tenants
* Customers, Clients and Guests
* Infrastructure

By the end of this article, you will probably realize how stupid it was to reduce BitShares to a shopping mall, but we will see that it allows to explain the concept easily. We will further realize that it has more to offer than "shops" for digital and physical goods but could be considered a **global business center**, instead.

Businesses offered by Existing Tenants
--------------------------------------

Let's have a look at the businesses (i.e. tenants) we already have in our shopping mall, or business center.

### Bank

One of our earliest Tenants is actually a bank union, and is owned by the business center itself. If you take a look at the malls in your local home tome, you will realize that they all have had a bank or at least an ATM from the beginning. Not only do they provide businesses within the mall with services such as safety deposits, providing payment services, but are also close when their customers need them during their stay in the shopping mall.

What is different with this bank is that

1. there is only one bank and
2. they don't make a profit out of your money!

On entry, every visitor of the mall gets a free bank account at that bank that they can use for shopping in that mall or doing business in the center. Interestingly, this bank has some where unique value proposition compared to regular banks, namely, that their accounts are so secure, that they can't access your account(s) themselves while they give you full flexibility and account control. So it's your choice whom you give access to your funds, maybe to your wife, maybe not.

However, similar to other banks, our bank also has branches outside our global center which allows people to use their bank accounts with any other business. All they need is an internet connection and they are ready to go. Once a business is connected, they can leverage all the advantages of this bank, such as

* light-speed transfers across the globe
* censorship resistance
* inherent multi-currency support
* light-weight mobile wallet support
* secure bank accounts with industry-grade encryption

Soon, we will see a Bank and Exchange Union in order to bring other banks, exchanges and financial institutes to our business center. This will bring fungible assets backed by secured outside collateral and significantly improved liquidity to our clients.

### Marktplace / Exchange

One of BitShares' biggest tenants is a marketplace but some call it exchange. The reason for this is that you can use it to trade anything, from foreign currencies, commodity and stock exchange, to gift-cards, event tickets and digital goods.

Yhea, figure that out: Our business center has an international, globally accessible, open all-day exchange! Anyhow, this exchange is owned by the center as well and generates some nice little revenue for our shareholders already.

Visitors benefit from this exchange as their are no doormen ensuring that only the rich can get richer. No, this exchanges can be visited and used by anyone that has a (free) bank account at our bank. They of course also offer every business in the center, or any visitor to create their own digital good and have it trade on a global scale instantly. Kick-starting your business idea with a large-scale crowdfunding becomes an act of minutes.

### Small Businesses

Other tenants that have already established their business offer a variety of services to visitors and are in the

* privacy business (STEALTH),
* security business (2FA), and
* betting and prediction business

and more. Given the extremely low rent they pay to the business center, they offer their services at extremely convenient fees.

Planned Services, Businesses and Opportunities
----------------------------------------------

### P2P Lending

As you read this, shareholders are negotiations with developers around the world in order to bring a fast and secure lending market to our clients and visitors. Imagine a market hall crowded with people that don't wait for credit clearance from a handful of institutions, but instead loan their goods, services and assets to each other directly. This way, people benefit from lower fees because their are no middlemen involved while risk is mostly absorbed by the protocol and slightly higher collateral.

### Secure Decentralized Messaging

With ultra low (later even zero) fees for simple transfers that can carry arbitrary text messages, a trust-less, censorship-resistant and cryptographically secure messaging across the mall, we have our own version of WhatsApp, just more secure and more private! The infrastructure for this services will be offered by the BitShares center and profits can be made by offering the best, nicest and most user-friendly front-end. No more setting up of servers, databases, redundancy or security for those messages. It's all included in BitShares, already!

### Subscriptions

Our own bank improves its services constantly and now offers their customers a way to setup withdrawal permissions for their accounts. This would allow businesses to establish a subscription models that can leverage all the advantages of our banks. You could give your wife her own bank account while sharing limited resources, ... or not.

### Crowdfunding

The existing exchange offers to trade assets of any kind and opportunities exist to build business around offering new kinds of assets, such as crowdfunding assets. This allows anybody to help fund your idea and instead of rewarding them with a sweat-shirt or a sticker, you can let them participate in your success buy sharing profits with your early investors. This could bring in a flood of money to awesome proposals!

### P2P Insurance

Once we have established a greater user base, we can leverage inertia and will be able to offer a variety of decentralized and peer-to-peer insurances. The benefits for society could be enormous as bureaucratic overhead and thus costs can be greatly reduced.

Become a Business Partner
-------------------------

Let's assume you have a great idea that you would like to offer to a world-wide audience and profit from providing a unique service, then you should consider becoming a tenant in our business center. By means of so called Fee Backed Assets (FBAs), we let you rent a room in the center and keep profits generated from your business. That way, you could fully fund your business on your own and keep all the profits, or crowd fund a portion while selling shares of your potential profits in the future. It is your choice!

As a brief example business case, we helped our Privacy Partner (STEALTH) offer his services to our customers. The clients pay a fee of which 20% are considered rent and 80% are profits to the sole investor that funded the development. The STEALTH shareholders have full control over prices of the services and can sell their shares of future profits.

Other business partners, such as OpenLedger.info, theDex.org, or bitCash.org profit from advertising and marketing our business center and shopping mall to the people. They build the highways to our decentralized ecosystem!

The Infrastructure
------------------

Let's discuss why is in it for the business center or shopping mall and its shareholders. The business center is called **BitShares* and it offers the infrastructure to tenants and customers, such as a parking garage, air conditioning, internet connectivity, a meeting hall, toilets and offers financial services via its own bank union, like local currencies, mall-wide or business wide gift cards as discussed above. Technically, these are implemented by means of a blockchain (how else) that offers:

* 3 seconds confirmation times
* inherent security and an audit trail by an immutable public ledger
* market-pegged and user-issued assets.

But the most important advantage of a blockchain fast enough to support many independent businesses is that you enter a frictionless economic environment where currencies, applications, smart contracts and entire enterprises can do business with greater liquidity, efficiency, market depth, network effect, and regulatory freedom.

As a consequence, our business center is decentralized throughout the planet, has no single point of failure and run autonomously, which means that computer programs deal with all operations and accounting in order to reduce costs and make tampering with the business models impossible. Furthermore, the BitShares business center is open 24/7/365 (366 as of 2016) and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.

Fortunately, our shopping mall is located at a place that is *close to* Las Vegas (but not in the U.S.), and also Shanghai (but not in China), while people from Europe don't need to travel much to get there as well. In fact, BitShares is located in no country but in all of them and non of them.

The network is governed by our shareholders (holders of "BTS" shares) which can vote for costs, operational parameters and business parameters and benefit from the rent paid by business partners and the revenue generated by fees of our bank and exchange.
