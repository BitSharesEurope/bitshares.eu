title: Public BitShares Testnet
---

BitShares Europe is happy to announce a [public BitShares testnet](http://testnet.bitshares.eu) open for anyone to use for anything. It comprises almost all features available to BitShares. It's core asset is called `TEST` and every user registering via the official faucet will be credited 1 Million `TEST` shares to play around with.

Some technical details as well as a tutorial about how to set up your own public or private testnet have been published in our [docs](http://docs.bitshares.eu/testnet/).

Some market-pegged assets, as well as prediction markets and user-issued assets already exist and are traded.

We encourage everyone to do what every they like with just two simple restrictions:

 * Nothing in the testnet will ever have *any* monetary value
 * The testnet might be reset any time

Please feel free to run your trading bots against the testnet for fine tweaking. Some are already present and trading in different markets. Please make use of any feature you would like to use. If you need more `TEST` tokens, require some chances in the blockchain parameters or would like to request a hard fork for testing new smart contracts, don't hesitate to contact either our [helpful community](http://bitsharestalk.org) or join our [Slack group](http://slack.bitshares.org).

Acknowledgement: Thanks to James (@riverhead) for providing the server infrastructure for the testnet for free. Please send him some love!
