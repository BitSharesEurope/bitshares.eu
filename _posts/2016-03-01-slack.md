title: BitShares now on Slack!
---

The community is happy to announce that we can now be reached via [Slack](http://bitshares2.slack.com) as well. You can get your individual invitation by visiting [slack.bitshares.org](http://slack.bitshares.org). This slack group serves as an supplement service for the public to get in contact with our awesome community.

With this step, we now have

* Our BitSharestalk.org forum for in-depth and technical discussions
* Some Telegram Groups for Individual real-time communications
* A Slack group as a quick on-ramp for new members to approach our community
* BitShares.org Mailing list for "official" announcements (as in any decentralized ecosystem :P)

Of course, it's your choice and we will defend your right to pick any or none of the above.
